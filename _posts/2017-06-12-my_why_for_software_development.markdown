I can't claim to be special. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of other people going through this Flatiron School, most of whom are probably better coders than I am or will ever hope to be. Thus my reasons to learn software development are probably the same as a lot of others.

I like to learn. I like to research and figure out the best option. I dislike waste, so I search for ways to be more efficient and optimize time and resources. I enjoy figuring out how to make things easier and more convenient. All of these are reasons, but the main reason that I decided to learn software development is so that I could solve problems and help people. Whether it be helping people manage their money and connect with others or as simple as making a website more user friendly, I just want to help others.

A lot of people want to be original, to do extraordinary things. Me? I'll settle for ordinary as long as I can have people in my life who I think are extraordinary, who I love and who love me back - my wife, my daughter, my family, my friends, my current and future work associates, and other extraordinary people I meet in this journey of life.
