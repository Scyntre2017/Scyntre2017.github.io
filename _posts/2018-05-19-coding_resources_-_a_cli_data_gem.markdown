Right before I got back into working on this CLI project I read a [post](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-do-i-stop-being-lazy/) by Ramit Sethi about how to stop being lazy and finish what you start. In it he outlined four steps to make sure that you started and finished the things that are important to you.

1. Give yourself permission to fail, permission to not do something perfectly the first time you try.
2. Honor your word, even if it's just to yourself. Be a person of integrity.
3. Plan how you are going to work through things and break your tasks into manageable steps.
4. Get others to keep you accountable.

I used all these steps in the process of finishing this project. I had to learn to write code without worrying if it would be good or not before I started. I learned to stick to what I said I would do, barring unforeseen emergencies. I learned to plan my code and my work. I also reached out to an educational coach and had my wife and the coach keep me accountable to what I said I would do.

My CLI data gem is a gem that pulls a list of books from FreeTechBooks.com and lists them out for the user and also allows the user to search for a specific book.

Through this project I learned a lot about building a working command line application in Ruby and turning it into a working Ruby gem. I learned how to think through problems and how to build different functionality into a program. I learned more how to research and ask for help to solve multiple problems I ran into. Most importantly though I learned to stick to this until I was finished.
